## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Secure User Authentication**: Robust user sign-up and sign-in functionality with password hashing using `bcrypt` and session management via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
-   **Account Management**: Users get a dedicated wallet upon registration with a randomly assigned starting balance.
-   **Real-time User Search**: Instantly find and filter other users on the platform to initiate a transfer.
-   **ACID-Compliant Transactions**: Core fund transfer logic is built using Mongoose sessions to ensure atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable (ACID) transactions, preventing data corruption and loss of funds.
-   **Dynamic & Responsive UI**: A clean, modern, and intuitive user interface built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS for a seamless experience on all devices.
-   **RESTful API**: A well-structured and documented backend API to handle all application logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed
-   MongoDB installed and running, or a MongoDB Atlas connection string

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the backend directory
    cd backend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /backend directory and add the following variables
    # MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
    # JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    # PORT=3000

    # Start the backend server
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    ```sh
    # Navigate to the frontend directory from the root
    cd frontend

    # Install NPM packages
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /frontend directory and add the following variable
    # VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
